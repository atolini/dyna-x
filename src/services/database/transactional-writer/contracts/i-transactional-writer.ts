 *
 * This interface is useful for implementing data consistency across multiple writes,
 * such as with DynamoDB's `TransactWriteItems` or similar mechanisms in other databases.
 *
 * @template Container - The identifier type for the target container (e.g., table name, collection name).
 * @template Item - The data type of the item to be written.

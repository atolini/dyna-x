# CloudWatchLogService - Logger Implementation

This package provides a concrete implementation of the [`Log Service`](../../contracts/README.md) using [AWS CloudWatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to send log entries.

It fulfills the abstraction defined by the [`Log Service`](../../contracts/README.md), enabling integration with systems expecting a standardized logging service contract.

## üìò Service Details

This service is composed of a single main class that allows writing logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs.

### 1. `CloudWatchLogService<T>`

**Implements**: [`ILogService<T, LogContainer>`](../../contracts/README.md)

**Main Methods:**

- `putLog(logs: T[], logContainerId: LogContainer): Promise<void>` ‚Äî Sends an array of log entries to the specified CloudWatch Logs destination, resolving log group and stream based on the provided log container ID. Automatically handles the sequence token for the log stream.

---

## üöÄ Usage Example

```typescript
import { CloudWatchLogService } from './cloudwatch-logs';
import { LogContainer } from '../../contracts';

const logService = new CloudWatchLogService<{ message: string }>();

const logContainer: LogContainer = {
  logGroupName: 'my-log-group',
  logStreamName: 'my-log-stream',
};

const logs = [{ message: 'Log entry 1' }, { message: 'Log entry 2' }];

await logService.putLog(logs, logContainer);
```

## üì¢ Notes

- This implementation uses the AWS SDK v3 (`@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs`).
- Ensure that the provided log group and stream exist in your AWS account, or create them before sending logs.
- Be aware of CloudWatch Logs limits, such as rate limits for log entries.
